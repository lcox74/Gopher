# Gopher
> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1436

This is just a study on the Gopher protocol. I'll be attempting to create a 
terminal based client followed with a server implementation following the
[spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1436).

I'll be working on the client first. Starting with getting a response and then
formatting the response properly to use.

I'm using the following host as a testing server due to it being currently
active: `gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher` 
([http proxy](http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite)).
